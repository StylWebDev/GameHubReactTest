# GameHubReactTest

**GameHubReactTest** is a simple React + TypeScript app built with Vite — my first full‑project endeavour to explore React development, experiment with state management, and build a small “game hub” interface.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- A modern front‑end setup using **React** with **TypeScript** for type‑safety.
- A build system with **Vite**, offering fast development reloads and optimized build output. ([github.com](https://github.com/StylWebDev/GameHubReactTest))
- ESLint and TS config to keep code clean and consistent. ([github.com](https://github.com/StylWebDev/GameHubReactTest))
- A small UI that organizes and displays game‑related data (or at least the structure for such).

---

## 🧰 Features

- TypeScript support (strong typing for React components, hooks, etc.)
- React component structure (functional components + hooks)
- Modern build workflow (Vite)
- ESLint + TSConfig setup tuned for React/TS
- Basic folder structure (e.g., `src`, `public`) and config files (e.g., `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`) already in place

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StylWebDev/GameHubReactTest.git
   cd GameHubReactTest
   ```

2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Build for production  
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

5. Preview the production build locally  
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   # or
   yarn preview
   ```

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Here’s a quick look at the folder/file layout:
```
/
├─ public/
├─ src/
│   ├─ components/
│   ├─ pages/
│   ├─ assets/
│   ├─ App.tsx
│   └─ main.tsx
├─ .gitignore
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ tsconfig.app.json
├─ tsconfig.node.json
├─ vite.config.ts
└─ README.md
```
*(Note: The exact structure may vary slightly.)*

Highlights:
- `src/` – where your React/TS code lives.
- `public/` – static assets served as‑is.
- TypeScript config files (`tsconfig.*.json`) for app & node environments.

---

## 🛠️ Why This Stack?

- **React + TypeScript** gives the power of component‑based UI + type safety.
- **Vite** is fast, minimal, and optimised for modern web development.
- ESLint + TSConfig help maintain code quality and avoid common mistakes.
- Great for experimentation: since this is your first React project, the setup focuses on learning and iterating.

## 🎯 What’s Next / Planned Improvements

Here are some ideas for further development:
- Add routing (e.g., using `react‑router`) for multiple views/pages.
- Integrate a game API (fetch list of games, game details, etc.).
- Add state management (Context API, Zustand, Redux, etc.).
- Write unit/integration tests (e.g., using Jest + React Testing Library).
- Improve UI/UX (design, responsive layout, animations).
- Add deployment pipeline (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
- Add more linting/formatting rules or stricter TS settings for production readiness.

## 🤝 Contributing

Since this is currently a learning project, feel free to:
- Fork the repository and experiment.
- Submit pull requests with features or fixes.
- Raise issues if you spot bugs or have suggestions for improvements.

Please follow these basic conventions:
- Use TypeScript for new components.
- Keep naming consistent (`CamelCase` for components, `kebab-case` or `camelCase` for files as per project preference).
- Write clear commit messages.
